# Libft

**You very first own library.**

When it comes to programming, you always need a lot of functions. To avoid using an entire hard disk for your utils files, it could be a good idea to condense all the functions you use all the time in a library : An archive containing multiples functions. So, here is my Libft project for the 42 cursus, that condense a total of 43 functions, and obtained 125/100 and the outstanding project mention !
## Documentation

All the functions of the projects are rigorously documented in the header file (libft.h), separated in 5 categories :
- is: All the boolean functions that are asking a question to a variable. *("Are you a letter?")*
- mem: All the functions that are directly looking into memory areas. *("Is this byte the same as this one?")*
- str: All the functions that are interacting with strings. *("How many characters are there in this string?")*
- put: All the functions that are printing something. *("Let's display 42 in this file!")*
- lst (bonus) : All the functions that are interacting with linked list. *("How many nodes do I have ?")*
## Tests

All the tests of the [francinette](https://github.com/xicodomingues/francinette) pass, strict mode included. 


## Usage

To compile the libft, just run
```Makefile
make
```
If you want to test the bonus files, you can run
```Makefile
make bonus
```
